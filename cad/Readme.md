# Smart trainers compatibility

Some smart trainers like the Tacx Neo 2T do not allow rotation on the rear wheel hub because of small teeth in the trainer axle adapters.  
In order to allow rotation without damaging the bike frame, several plastic parts similar to washers are available here:
- Neo2T_Cog-short.stl (Cog side of the trainer)
- Neo2T_Thick long.stl (Other side of the trainer)
